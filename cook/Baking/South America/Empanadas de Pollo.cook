Mix @all-purpose flour{250%g} with @butter{125%g} and add @cold water{80%ml}. 
Knead well and wrap the slightly sticky dough in plastic wrap. Let it rest in the refrigerator for ~{1%hour} at 4-8°C.

For the filling, boil @eggs{2} until hard-boiled. Cook the @chicken breast{1} with @salt, @pepper, one clove of @garlic{}, and @onion{1/2}.

Slice the onion into thin strips and grate the carrot. Sauté the onion in olive oil until translucent. Then add the grated carrots and cook until they turn yellow-orange. Add the garlic.

Shred the cooked chicken into fibers and add it to the onions. Season with salt, pepper, and a little chicken broth.

Roll out the dough very thinly and cut out circles with a bowl (15-20 cm radius). Spread the filling on one half of each circle, leaving a one-centimeter border. Moisten the border with a wet finger. Then bury an eighth of an egg and an olive in the filling. Seal the pastry and press the edges together with a fork.

Brush the finished pastry pockets with egg yolk. Bake in the oven until golden brown.
