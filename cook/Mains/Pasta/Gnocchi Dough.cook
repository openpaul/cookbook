Wash and boil @potatoes{800%g} until tender.
Drain the potatoes and peel the potatoes while they are still warm. 
Mash them with a potato ricer or a fork. Let them steam out to reduce moisture.

Add up to @flour{130%g}, @egg{1} and @salt{1/2%tsp}. Mix well to form a dough.
Be careful not to overwork the dough or add too much flour, as this will result in tough gnocchi. 
The dough should be soft and pliable, but not too wet.

Divide the dough into several portions and roll each portion into a long, thin rope.
Cut the ropes into small pieces, about \SI{2}{\cm} in length.
Using a fork, press each piece of dough gently to create ridges.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and boil each gnocchi for up to ~{2%min} or until floating.
