Boil @Potatoes{1%Kg} until very soft. Make sure to not boil in too much water as to not have soggy potatoes.

Peel the potatoes while warm and add @butter{80%g} and @Milk{200%ml}.

Add @salt and @nutmeg and then stomp until consistency has reached smooth/chunky. Add more milk and butter if it seems dry. 
Taste it until you are happy. Reheat in microwave before serving.

**Extra Fluffy**: Use a potato ricer to mash the potatoes and then mix the other ingredients gently in.
