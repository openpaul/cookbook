Peel then grate @potatoes{} (measurement needed). 
Put all grated potatoes into a cloth and squeeze out moisture as much as possible (really important step).

Now season with @salt, @pepper and some @nutmeg. 

In a pan add @butter{20%g} and then the seasoned potatoes. Shape into a disk and ensure all is nice and compact. 
The disk should be 2.5 cm thick. 

Cook on medium heat with a lid on until the underside gets crispy. Use a plate to flip over to the other side and add more butter as needed.
