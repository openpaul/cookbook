# :stew: Recipes ðŸ“– 

This is a collection of recipes we like to cook at home. Some recipes are well written and others are more like 
notes to us to remember that we could cook this dish again. 

Feel free to use the recipes as you wish or as an inspiration for what to cook next.

All recipes are also provided as a PDF file to print on double sided A5 index cards: [Recipes.pdf](recipes.pdf)
